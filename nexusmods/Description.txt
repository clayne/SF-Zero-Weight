[u][size=3][b]Introduction[/b][/size][/u]
As someone who doesn't like to deal with the weight of loot in looter games, a mod like this is always the first thing I install. I wondered why no one had made a mod like this yet, so I decided to make one myself.

[size=4][u][b]Description[/b][/u][/size]
The mod / SFSE plugin patches the game so that the current weight (mass) of your ship is always zero. It simply allows you to loot as much you want and take anything with you.  
The mod doesn't change your save file, as soon you uninstall it, your weight/mass is back to normal.
