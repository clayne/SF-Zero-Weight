[size=4][b]Game Update Information[/b][/size]
The mod uses signature scanning to find the correct address for the patch. It doesn't need updates until SFSE refuses to load it or it stops working after Bethesda changes the code I modify, in which case I have to change my code as well.
However, the SFSE itself must be updated after each game update!  
Make sure to update the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106]Starfield Script Extender (SFSE)[/url] for the version of the game you're using before reporting that the mod is not working.

Users of the ASI Loader version don't have to care about updates until the mod stops working. But, if you use the binkw32.dll of the ASI Loader, each game update will overwrite the DLL with the original one. Make sure that your ASI Loader is installed correctly after each game update.

Thanks to the byte pattern signature scan, the mod verifies the integrity automatically, therefore it should never crash your game, if the code mismatches after a game update. It will simply stop working.

[b][size=4]Bug Reporting[/size][/b]
If you're 100% sure that you're using the right SFSE for your game version and you still have trouble with the mod, please provide following information, if you want to report an issue.  
[list=1]
[*]Your game version and update version (Steam/GamePass/Cracked, version 1.7.36 etc.)
[*]Which mod version are you using, SFSE or ASI
[*]Your installation method, if you're using Vortex, MO2 or manually.
[*]Provide content of log files. For SFSE all logs should be in the Documents directory ([i]C:\Users\(windows user name)\Documents\My Games\Starfield\SFSE\Logs\[/i]), there I need the content of [b]sfse.txt[/b], [b]sfse_loader.txt[/b] and [b]SF-Zero-Weight.log[/b] files.
For the ASI version, if you use the v1.1.1 the log file [b]SF-Zero-Weight.log[/b] should be in the [i](game root)/Plugins/[/i] directory. For GamePass and v1.0.0 there are no logs, sorry.
